GIPHY API is designed to work as a animal gif search engine.
By typing the animal of your choice into the search bar, a button with the corresponding name will appear.
Once the button is clicked, a list of the top ten GIFs related to that search will appear in addition to the rating of the image.
You may click the image to pause and play the GIF.
